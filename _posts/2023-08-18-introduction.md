## I used to want to change the world

Since I was in middle school my greatest objective was to change the world.
Don't get me wrong, I didn't want to be a superhero who randomly save people and get nothing in retrun, my objective was different.
I wished to do so big of a discovery that people would remember me for the next centuries, that was my idea of overcoming death and living forever, pretty selfish huh?

Four years have passed since I finished highschool and I now jokingly laugh at my past self for being so cheeky.
Changing the world is a pretty hard thing to do, you know?
I barely manage to change bedsheets regularly as for now.

Today is the day I'm starting to change, not changing the world, I think that may still has to wait for a while, I want to change myself for the better.
I'm still selfish, I'm not writing this journal to help you overcome your problems, look, as for now I don't care about it, I don't care if you get your shit together, afterall I didn't manage to do it myself yet, that's the only reason this journal exists.
I'm writing for no one other than myself I want something to keep me motivated, I want something to look back to and tell myself how much have I improved and be proud of it.

I think trying to change the people around me is a hard task and I'm not able to do that yet, so that can wait, let alone changing the whole world.
I'm also still recovering from a bad time of my life, I had it hard finding any purpose of motivation although I tried, I tried so hard but the last two years have been for me nothing but realization of how bad my habits were, how poorly I spent my time and how little I was doing about fixing that.

I can't stand anymore crying over myself, I'm changing all I can.
I'm changing my routines, for circumstances I got to change the place I'm living for a couple of years, I changed all my on-line identities which I want to be as irrelevant and fragmented as possible, since time spent on-line doing nothing but passive consumption of content was one of the addictions that mostly want to eradicate from my life.

I will keep writing posts and publish them, yet again, not because I want to help you or any other person, but because starting with some strong statement will hopefully keep myself on tracks.
Also, if I only try to think about giving up, looking back at myself would just make me angry and unembarrassed.

I know you can achieve nothing without someone to push you, well, I shall be that someone, So good luck my future self, you have just been put in deep shit and the only way to get out of this is proving yourself.
