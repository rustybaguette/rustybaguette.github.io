Nice, it's been 3 days and I already have problems keeping up.

For the firs part yesterday was fine, I followed my routine with no flaws, went to the park to read as usual, but instead of going again to workout at 7p.m. I went out with friends (this is one of the reasons why I should start working out in the early morning, and not in the late afternoon/evening like I'm doing right now) and nothing bad here, problems arise when we o back home around 2a.m. and at 6a.m. in the evening I'm obviously too tired to do anything, so I follow my routine as usual: shower, going out for a bit and meditate, but at 6:30 I give up and go back to sleep with a new alarm set for 10a.m. Now I lost a lot of time and I am overall more tired than the past few days but I managed to do almost everything by now except for the morning "workout" that is really just a warm up.

And I will start writing again only when I finish it

Starting from today I'm trying to follow a real workout routine, up until now I was only going at the park doing a bunch of exercises that felt right, but that way exercises are inconsistent so I only poorly train random parts of my body and the only thing that really comes out of this is the tiredness and pain from doing exercises.

For the other stuff I think it will take a while before I can call it some real progress.
