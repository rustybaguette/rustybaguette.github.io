## Workout the past days

Yesteday was the first real workout, I planned to write about it earlier but again, I got went to sleep pretty late and had to do the "double sleep" again, today I sleep for 4:30h until 6a.m. then again from 6:30 to 10:00.

I managed then to do some chores and met at the park with friends, no actual workout in the morning tho.

As the title suggest, yesterday was the first real workout, using the Garmin app I put together a small card to tire more or less all the main muscles and I have to say, it worked, it's painful to walk, to cycle and sometimes it even hurt my buttocks to seat on the park's granite benches.

Today's workout was a bit easier: some curl using my backpack filled with stones, don't know the exact weight, but I put three big stones and it seemed heavy enough.
Some push-ups and at the end plank.
Again, not an heavy workout, but together with the cycling to get to the park and back, it was pretty tiring.
Tomorrow will probably be like the last two days (going to sleep late and sleeping again) because I'm seeing some friends before leaving.

## Strange thought: dreams

Something I noticed almost instantly when trying to keep a fixed sleep schedule was that I dreamed a lot more than I could remember: I had surely more dreams per night and they all appeared as long and vivid, not some strange events in faded colors like I had before.
Also in these new dreams I found much less in uncomfortable situations, like the sensation of running and finding myself moving really slowly regardless the struggle.

This is good per se, but one morning (probably two days ago, can't remember) I started thinking about the implications of dreaming and enjoying it.

It remembered me a lot of playing games in the sense that it's possible to live some experience that doesn't necessarily follows reality's laws and that has no repercussions on the real world.
I started thinking about advantages and disadvantages of dreaming over playing video games, the first one is "better" in some senses since you dream anyway when you sleep so it's not wasted time, it feels more realistic (I challenge you to find a VR game that feels more realistic than a dream), but can get problematic if it becomes a reason not to waking up, the second one obviously is less immersive, but follows a constructed story (I'm talking mostly about story-driven games), it's possible to share the experience, listen to the music, but obviously requires actual time to play.

Probably all this thought also came up to my mind following the stuff I'm reading now and I like in general.
