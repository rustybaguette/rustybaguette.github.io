Regardless the fact that I slept just 4:something hours I don't feel as tired as the previous days, I will sleep some more tho since I'm aware that sleeping just 4h is nowere near enough.

Today's workout will probably be much lighter than the previous days (probably the same but less reps), since I still have muscle pain existing.

I began to listen to music or podcasts regularly while doing other stuff like chores and cooking, sometime I listen to story-telling YouTube videos or videos about some topic I'm interested to, just listening tho the voices without actually looking at it, I'm a bit sorry because lot of the creators I follow do story telling or talks about topics through their own animations (like Jaiden, Noralities, TheStarfishface and such) and by just listening I can't really appreciate their art, so sometimes I instead listen to them while keeping the video visible on my laptop or phone and occasionally look at them to keep following the story (hope all artists out there will forgive me, I really appreciate your work and your videos).
  
This post is a bit shorter than the other ones since I've not really something to talk about and I'm helping my parents moving stuff at home.
