How hypocritical of me writing about fixing my schedule at this time of the day (even worse, check the time of commit). I wanted to go out on a bike trip with a friend of mine and we ended up going a bit far, destroyed my sleep schedule but was a fun talk.

I had in mind to write this way earlier but I got carried away by chores and reading web stuff, sorry.

First of all I should admit cold shower are amazing in the morning, when you are still sleepy and tired from the night just throw yourself under cold water and it wakes you up instantly, perfect way for starting the morning, if nothing else.

Regarding my morning routine I managed to follow it yesterday since I went to sleep at a reasonable time (not like today) and that felt pretty nice.

I also need to apology to both my past and future self for not being able to workout today, had some errands to do, started preparing the luggage and misunderstood the date me and my friends were going to see Oppenheimer, so I totally skipped today's workout, if not for the morning's and evening's bike rides.
I didn't want a "day-off" for the first time because the objective was to put me in the right mindset to keep a consistent schedule of whatever (workout in this particular case).

I **MUST** Do both morning pre-workout and afternoon workout tomorrow, to get back on tracks, at least.

I'm still not sure if it's better to do journaling in the morning or in the evening.
The first help me keeping the schedule consistent and may stimulate me more, also prevent me from finding myself in situations like this one (LOOK AT THE TIME).
The latter, on the other hand, allow me to talk in a more precise way about events, since they are "today's" events and are more clear to me than "yesterday's" events.
