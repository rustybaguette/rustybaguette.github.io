Ok, like yesterday, I'm writing this a bit late, but today it's my fault, I've been up finishing stuff to read.

Managed to go to the park pretty early (around 8 a.m.) and workout in the morning, felt pretty nice as I managed to get other things done by the afternoon.

I'm more or less keeping track of my goals, as well as bad habits I'm trying to remove, and while for most of the goals I'm keeping up pretty well, the same can't be said for bad habits, will probably do a weekly report on them in the future, which will be both extremely embarassing and, hopefully, useful.
