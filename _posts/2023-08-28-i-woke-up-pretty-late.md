OK, as you can notice by the giant hole (2 days) in my journal, I missed out a couple of days.
I procrastinated one of the two days to keep the posting in the evening until I went to bed; the following day I went outside almost the whole day, with only the morning to journal.

But this is not the worst yet, I also skipped a day of workout (yesterday I didn't even use the bike nor I did any kind of at-home workout, the day before I just took the bike).

Today I also just used the bike to move around as a "workout" in the afternoon.
But OK, not going all-out with the workout is fine for couple of days a week, **BUT** today, without my cat asking me for food since my parents came back, and with some hours (2) of sleep missing I didn't manage to wake up by 6a.m.
I don't know how it happened, I also have an alarm on my watch that is noisy AF and yet I slept through it.

I also almost finished to fill my baggage and I'm going to sleep pretty early, the following days I'll also meet with many friends.
I'll probably also start writing other stuff than the journal, such as recipes and travels I make, not sure if making this blog as a transcription of a vlog or simply recalling events and writing them, last time didn't go well.

Maybe writing in the evening is not good: there is a higher chance I miss some days either by accident or laziness, I go to sleep later, and more importantly, regardless having events of the whole day to talk about my posts have become shorter; maybe that's actually the reason, and I'm focusing more on past events of the day rather than a wider vision.
