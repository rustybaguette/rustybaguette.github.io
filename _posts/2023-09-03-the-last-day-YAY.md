As you probably already understood by the title, I'm finally leaving my country (not saying "finally" 'cause I hate it, I'm just really excited to do this experience).

In the past days I said goodbye to all the important people in my life, since I won't see them IRL for a while, surely I'll keep contact with them online.

I'm going to the airport tomorrow, pretty early, and will be on travel for about 21 hrs, so I won't post in a while, I will try to write about the flight tho.

I also found some other uses for this blog, such as keeping recipes I'll learn and writing about my days in general, I want to post some personal art, maybe I'll start drawing if I find some free time.

But I don't want to distract my focus too much from the original goal, so I'm going to keep the two separated and only post on the other one if I don't have something else to do already.
