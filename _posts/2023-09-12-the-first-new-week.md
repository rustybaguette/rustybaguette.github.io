I arrived in Japan a week ago, landing at the Kansai International Airport, after a little trouble with my baggage that shipped with a different fly, I got out from the airport and somehow managed to buy tickets for the bus and train to reach my destination.

I met with the guy who was in charge of guiding me to the real-estate company and met the landlord who, sadly, can't speak English, so the guy had to translate everything for me.

The past few days have been really intense, I went to the house market like twice a day because everytime I realized I was missing something at home, finding the time to do everything was a bit hard, but I managed more or less to recover from the jet lag (back to 7-8 sleep hrs) and re-establish my morning routine, more or less, I still don't have a mat or a carpet so I'm not working out now.

On the other hand I'm walking a LOT, like average 10k steps a day, the last three days I went over 25k.

Since the semester didn't start yet I went visiting near cities Kyoto and Nara, both alone and with a friend I just met who happens to know Italian pretty well, so he guided me around the city and helped me talking to people or teaching me Japanese and letting me talk to them, he teach me how to say something and then let me speak to the waiters to get the food, really nice.

I'm also starting to understand some kanji I see often and the meaning of some words and phrases.
I'm also learning some Asian recipes and I'm getting used on how things work here.

As for now I kinda settled, filling the apartment with all my stuff, organizing my day and keeping everything up.

For now I'm still almost like a tourist, I spent a shit ton of money on food around Kyoto, eating at the market and buying stuff I found interesting, but this will have to change once I start the lectures at university.

Luckily I quickly became friend with a group of Korean guys who also invited me at a welcome party the next Thursday, so I'll have the chance to meet and befriend with even more people, hopefully.
